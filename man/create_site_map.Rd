\title{Create a Site Map of Sensors and Sources}
\usage{
create_site_map(sensors, sources)
}
\arguments{
\item{sensors}{A data frame or matrix containing sensor locations. It must include:
- Either columns named \code{x} and \code{y}, or at least two columns where
  the first two are taken as \code{x} and \code{y} coordinates.}

\item{sources}{A data frame or matrix containing source locations. It must include:
- Either columns named \code{x} and \code{y}, or at least two columns where
  the first two are taken as \code{x} and \code{y} coordinates.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing a site map of sensors and sources.
}
\description{
This function generates a site map showing the locations of sensors and sources.
It accepts inputs as either data frames or matrices. In the event that extra
columns (e.g., z coordinates) are present, only the first two columns (or the
columns named "x" and "y" if available) will be used.

\examples{
\dontrun{
sensors <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(4, 5, 6))
sources <- data.frame(x = c(7, 8), y = c(9, 10))

create_site_map(sensors, sources)
