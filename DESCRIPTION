Description: Simulate and run the Gaussian puff forward atmospheric
    model in sensor (specific sensor coordinates) or grid (across the
    grid of a full oil and gas operations site) modes. Numerous 
    visualization options, including static and animated, 2D and 3D, 
    and a site map generator based on sensor and source coordinates.
