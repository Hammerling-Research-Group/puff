# Gaussian Puff Model Package

The puff package implements a computationally efficient Gaussian puff atmospheric dispersion model, 
which is useful to estimate methane emission start and end time (detection), source location (localization), 
and emission rate (quantification) using concentration observations from a network of point-in-space 
continuous monitoring systems.
