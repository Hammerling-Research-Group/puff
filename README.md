The puff package implements a computationally efficient Gaussian puff atmospheric dispersion model. A fast version of this [already exists in Python](https://github.com/rykerfish/FastGaussianPuff). This current effort, then, is to develop something similar in R. 

In process of updating now that package is live on CRAN.
