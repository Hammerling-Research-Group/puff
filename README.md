The `puff` package is primarily a visualization-focused package aimed at offering many ways to visualize emission dispersion plumes given some site-level information (e.g., wind conditions, emission rate, etc.). 

Though focused on visualization, `puff` also provides functions for simulating and running the Gaussian puff model in either `sensor` or `grid` mode. Sensor mode corresponds to running the model based on specific sensor locations, where as grid mode corresponds to running the model across a full site. See the [paper](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/672a296b7be152b1d00fcc60) or the [Python version](https://github.com/Hammerling-Research-Group/FastGaussianPuff) for more *model-specific* details. 

## Installation and Usage

Stable (on CRAN):

```{r}
install.packages("puff")

library(puff)
```

Dev:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("Hammerling-Research-Group/puff")
```

Once the user obtains output from the forward model (either via the `puff` package ([`simulate_sensor_mode()`](https://github.com/Hammerling-Research-Group/puff/blob/66d4ca87d25bceb9edd5f24f6aa9fe0fc2a17604/R/simulate_sensor_mode.R) or [`simulate_grid_mode()`](https://github.com/Hammerling-Research-Group/puff/blob/66d4ca87d25bceb9edd5f24f6aa9fe0fc2a17604/R/simulate_grid_mode.R)) or via some other approach), they can use their site details and concentration output to build numerous visualizations, including several static plots, 2D and 3D animated plots, and a site map generator based on sensor and source coordinates.
